We enjoy greeting any visitors, whether you are passing through or looking for a church family, or simply interested in faith and have questions. Whatever your reason you will find a warm reception and a decent cup of coffee waiting for you.</p><h2>WHAT TO EXPECT</h2><h4><strong>Start with a coffee..</strong></h4><p>We always start with tea and coffee and an opportunity to greet visitors, catch up briefly with friends and enjoy being together. Community is important to us. We also follow our meetings with more time for refreshments.</p><h4><strong>Worship and a message</strong></h4><p>Our meetings start with worship. We call this 'open worship', which means there is more of a flow of singing, praise and prayers together followed by a talk from the bible with some application. We believe in the desire of God to speak to us and also to change our lives, even in this gathering.</p><h2>FOR ALL AGES</h2><h4><strong>Young and old are welcome</strong></h4><p>Youth and children go out to their own groups instead of the bible talk. We are a family church so we love the little ones and they are free to be involved in our worship together. We have a variety of groups running while the Sunday message is shared including Adventurers up till 7 and Explorers from 8-14 years. Our older teenagers join the main church in the meeting.</p><h2>GET CONNECTED</h2><h4><strong>Church for us is more than Sundays</strong></h4><p>We have various Community Groups that happen during the week.

God was moving in amazing ways at the time we moved three doors up to 1 Eltham Green for the main meetings while the Sunday School remained at number 4. Soon the numbers had reached 130 people. We had to soon move on as the gathering was causing problems for the neighbours.</p><p>In 1981 after some temporary homes the church purchased the Methodist Church building on the corner of Haimo Road, a short distance from Eltham Green. In 1982 the church moved in and this has been our church building since. The building has grown through development to include more rooms, a larger main hall, two residential flats and more recently a Coffee Shop.</p><p>Our heart has always been to be a centre in the community where the church and local community can connect together, with the church blessing the local community. In 2017 we started the Fresh Ground Coffee House which has seen our building opened up for many who simply want to have a drink or lunch, or to attend a wide variety of activities for the family.</p><h2>An independent, networking, church</h2><p>We are part of a network of churches called <a href=\"http://www.missionlifegrace.net\" target=\"_blank\">MissionLifeGrace (MLG)</a>.
