We extend to you a warm welcome. If you have not been with us on a Sunday we encourage you to come along at <strong>11:00am</strong> (doors open at 10:30 - usually for refreshments, except over August we start with prayer). We enjoy greeting any visitors, whether you are passing through or looking for a church family, or simply interested in faith and have questions. Whatever your reason you will find a warm reception and a decent cup of coffee waiting for you.</p><h2>WHAT TO EXPECT</h2><h4><strong>Start with a coffee..</strong></h4><p>We always start with tea and coffee and an opportunity to greet visitors, catch up briefly with friends and enjoy being together. Community is important to us. We also follow our meetings with more time for refreshments.</p><h4><strong>Worship and a message</strong></h4><p>Our meetings start with worship. We call this 'open worship', which means there is more of a flow of singing, praise and prayers together followed by a talk from the bible with some application. We believe in the desire of God to speak to us and also to change our lives, even in this gathering.</p><h2>FOR ALL AGES</h2><h4><strong>Young and old are welcome</strong></h4><p>Youth and children go out to their own groups instead of the bible talk. We are a family church so we love the little ones and they are free to be involved in our worship together. We have a variety of groups running while the Sunday message is shared including Adventurers up till 7 and Explorers from 8-14 years. Our older teenagers join the main church in the meeting.</p><h2>GET CONNECTED</h2><h4><strong>Church for us is more than Sundays</strong></h4><p>We have various Community Groups that happen during the week.

A group of churches walking together to love God, share the love of God to the world and grow disciples. We are all independent but share the same heart for God. We are evangelical, charismatic and seek to live out the life of God in holy living as we see in the scriptures.</p><h2>A church family</h2><p>Originally started as a house church we still hold those benefits of family life. We love to do things together including our children. We love to care for and support one another. We certainly are not a church that is content to 'just turn up'.</p><h2>A church of community groups</h2><p>We believe that church is more than a Sunday meeting. Community Groups (Life Groups) are at the heart of how we do church. These smaller groups meet regularly to study the Bible, pray together, support one another, and reach out to our community.</p>","published":true,"order":2,"sections":[{"type":"text","id":"history-section","backgroundColor":"white","padding":"large","alignment":"center","maxWidth":"4xl","title":"Loving Eltham since 1979","content":"<p>Formed in Eltham in 1975 as Eltham Green Fellowship at 4 Eltham Green, the church grew within the next 18 months to 100 people gathering in the home.
