# Refund Policy

**OnNuma – Volunteer Organisation Platform**  
**Operated by Seemus Design & Web, trading as OnNuma**  
**Last updated:** February 2025

## 1. Overview

This Refund Policy explains how refunds and cancellations work for paid subscriptions to OnNuma. Payments for OnNuma plans (e.g. Professional, Enterprise) are processed by our payment provider (Paddle). Your contract for the subscription is with us (Seemus Design & Web, trading as OnNuma); Paddle facilitates payment and may appear on your bank or card statement.

## 2. Subscription billing

- Subscriptions are billed in advance (e.g. monthly or annually) according to the plan you chose.
- Fees are charged at the start of each billing period. Your subscription will renew automatically unless you cancel before the end of the current period.
- You can view and manage your subscription (including cancellation) via the billing/account settings in the OnNuma Hub or via the link provided in your plan confirmation.

## 3. Cancellation

- **By you**: You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period. You will retain access to paid features until that date; no further charges will be made after cancellation.
- **By us**: We may suspend or cancel your subscription if you breach our Terms and Conditions, fail to pay, or for other serious reasons as set out in those terms.

## 4. Refunds

### 4.1 General rule

We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods (e.g. for the unused part of a month or year after you cancel). Once a billing period has been charged, that charge is non-refundable except as set out below.

### 4.2 Exceptions

We may, at our discretion, offer a full or partial refund in the following situations:

- **Duplicate or erroneous charge**: If you were charged in error or charged twice for the same period, we will refund the duplicate or incorrect amount.
- **Service failure**: If the Service was unavailable or materially defective for a significant part of a billing period and we could not resolve the issue, we may refund a proportionate part of the fee for that period.
- **Cooling-off (where required by law)**: If you are a consumer and the law in your country gives you a right to cancel and get a refund within a short period (e.g. 14 days), we will honour that right. Contact us promptly after purchase if you wish to exercise it.

### 4.3 How to request a refund

To request a refund under the exceptions above, contact us using the contact details on the OnNuma website or in your account/settings. Please include your account/organisation name and the transaction or billing period concerned. We will respond and, where we agree a refund is due, process it within a reasonable time. Refunds will be made to the original payment method where possible.

## 5. Chargebacks

If you dispute a charge with your bank or card issuer (chargeback) without first contacting us, we may suspend your account until the dispute is resolved. We will provide relevant information to the payment provider to resolve the dispute. Where a chargeback is found in your favour, we will not issue a separate refund for the same amount.

## 6. Changes to this policy

We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will change when we do. Material changes may be communicated by email or through the Service. Continued use of a paid plan after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 7. Contact

For questions about refunds, cancellations, or billing, please contact us at the address or email published on the OnNuma website or in your account/settings.
